编译原理是大学本科中非常重要又难以掌握的一门课，它又分为前端与后端的俩
部分内容，在本科学习中，主要学习的就是编译器前端的内容，然而前端的内容
虽然业界已经有很多成型的算法，但是学生在理解这些算法的时候，普遍存在着
难以真正学会的问题，大多数情况下只有大体的印象，而没有直观的认识与细节
的掌握。这个课题的提出就是为了实现一个系统，能够通过可视化的方式有效解
决这个问题，同时也尝试激发学生们对学习编译原理的热情，让编译原理的学习
不再枯燥无味。

 Compiler theory is the college is very important and difficult to
master a course, it is divided into two parts front and back of
undergraduate study is mainly learning compiler front-end, but the
contents of the front end, although the industry has there are many
forming algorithm, but the students understand these algorithms time,
the prevalence of the problem is difficult to really learn, and in
most cases only a rough impression, but there is no intuitive
understanding and grasp of the details. The issue raised is to
implement a system that can effectively solve this problem visually,
but also try to stimulate students' enthusiasm for learning compiler
theory, so learning compiler theory is no longer boring .
